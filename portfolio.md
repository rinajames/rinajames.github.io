## Radicalization in the Online Context: Accounting for User Trajectories Across Extremist Spaces  

In my dissertation research, I analyzed user engagement in far-right male supremacist communities on Reddit to predict radicalization-related outcomes. Data on more than 31 million Reddit submissions and comments was extracted from compressed JSON files using Python, and imported into Stata for analysis. Through negative binomial regression and survival analysis of derived data for 1,100,554 unique user profiles, I determined individual and community level factors driving migration into more extreme far-right spaces; in particular, findings highlighted that the odds of migration into more extreme communities were 40% higher for users impacted by platform-level sanctions such as community quarantines or bans.

## Strauf's Cafe Expansion (Bootcamp project)  

My team’s goal was to identify the viability of expanding operating hours and offerings at a campus coffee shop near Ohio State University. We acquired data from OSU demographic reports, competitor reviews, and employee/customer surveys to determine market demand, and identified that 74% of potential customers were interested in late-night spaces offering coffee and alcohol.

## 2024 Professional Learning Evaluation  

This project evaluated school district staff’s experiences with professional learning offerings to assess effectiveness. Data was collected in Qualtrics via post-learning surveys administered to 123 attendees. Through analysis in Excel, I determined the mean likelihood of recommending the professional learnings to colleagues was 8.6 on a scale of 1 to 10, but that professionals attending STEM/Science learnings shows much lower rates of satisfaction with the trainings. Findings were presented to the Director of Teaching & Learning and department specialists to inform offerings in subsequent years.

## UA Sociology DEI Climate Report   

This initiative assessed DEI-related issues experienced by graduate students within the University of Arizona School of Sociology in order to provide recommendations for addressing inequities. Data was collected via a survey incorporating both closed and open-ended questions, which was administered to 54 doctoral students using Qualtrics, and 9 focus groups with 24 total participants. Results indicated that 60%+ of graduate students had experienced or witness instances of hostility or discrimination, 75%+ had experienced financial insecurity, and that 30% experienced a lack of support with caregiving responsibilities. Findings were distributed to School of Sociology leadership in the form of both a formal report and oral presentation, and provided concrete action items to address DEI issues and improve equity.
