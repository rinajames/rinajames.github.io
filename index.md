I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Arizona, working at the intersection of gender, online engagement, and far-right politics. Methodologically, I specialize in big data, data wrangling, and advanced quantitative methods including multilevel modeling and survival analysis. In my dissertation research, I draw on computational and quantitative methods in Python and Stata to analyze radicalization-related outcomes for 1 million+ users active in secular male supremacist Reddit communities.

Messy data is my first love–I enjoy creating order from chaos, and translating unwieldy datasets into actionable insights. Currently, I’m seeking roles where I can leverage my experience working with large, complex data in order to solve real-world problems that serve the social good.
