I'm a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Arizona with a background in data wrangling, advanced quantitative methods, and computational social science. I excel at data cleaning, preparation, and analysis, and in using derived data to glean new insights from existing sourcesâ€”my most recent research uses Reddit post data to map user trajectories across, and churn within, far-right male supremacist communities, in order to inform intervention efforts and platform policies around extremism. Currently, I'm seeking industry and alt-ac roles that use complex data to tackle prominent social issues.
